Initial root folder structure

WebApp
├── API                      => API Services -> could use Middleware/Libraries/Business Rules etec
├── Database                 => Database Access layer (if needed); Can contain interfaces to multiple interfaces (sqlite,mysql,postgres); SQL scripts to setup fresh database
├── Middleware               => Main business rules - the real application, authentication mechanisms etc
└── UI                       => UI componets and logic

These can be split into multiple projects/repos if needed

In order to add these empty folders to github we need to place .gitkeep to each empty folder:

$find . -type d -empty -not -path "./.git/*" -exec touch {}/.gitkeep \;

Questions: 

How does session handling works with next.js?
How to host the application under a Web Server such as apache or nginx?
